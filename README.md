# Chess_project
AI Chess Game Project with Unity Integration
This project is a complex and engaging AI-powered chess game designed to create an intelligent opponent capable of playing at various difficulty levels. By combining traditional game development with advanced artificial intelligence techniques, it simulates a strategic, human-like chess opponent.

Developed using C# in the Unity engine, the game offers an interactive and visually appealing chess interface. The AI component utilizes machine learning algorithms and is trained on a range of chess strategies using libraries such as TensorFlow and scikit-learn. The decision-making process is powered by the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta pruning, ensuring optimized performance and adaptability to different player skill levels.

The integration of these technologies results in a sophisticated chess game, delivering an immersive experience while showcasing the potential of modern AI in game development.
